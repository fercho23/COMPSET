validator module:  the messages file will be divided into many files with the cases: es, en , br, etc

exception handler or/and error handler?

exception handler to database logs (see error_log function)

error handler to frontend client

keep out "if (!$authorized) die('authorization error');" from Application class, use the ResponseHandler into used components.
